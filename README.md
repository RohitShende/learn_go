My journey of learning GO Lang

I am starting my journey with the Help of Chat GPT.

`I asked chat GPT how to start learning GO Lang and It gave me resources` :smile:

Here is the full output from Chat GPT:

Learning a new programming language in just one week is an ambitious goal, but I can certainly provide you with a structured plan to get started with Go (also known as Golang) and make significant progress. Here's a one-week plan to help you learn the basics of Go:

**Day 1: Introduction to Go**
- Begin by understanding what Go is and its key features.
- Install Go on your computer (if not already installed).
- Learn how to set up your Go workspace.
- Write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go.
- Familiarize yourself with the Go compiler and how to run Go programs.

**Day 2: Basic Syntax**
- Study Go's basic syntax, including variables, data types, and constants.
- Learn how to declare and initialize variables in Go.
- Explore basic input/output in Go.
- Practice writing simple programs to manipulate variables.

**Day 3: Control Structures**
- Dive into control structures such as if statements and loops.
- Learn about conditional statements in Go.
- Write programs that use if-else and switch statements.
- Practice with for and while loops in Go.

**Day 4: Functions and Packages**
- Understand how functions work in Go.
- Create your own functions and use built-in functions.
- Learn about packages and how to import and use them.
- Write programs that use functions from external packages.

**Day 5: Data Structures**
- Study arrays, slices, and maps in Go.
- Learn how to create and manipulate these data structures.
- Practice with different data structures in various programs.

**Day 6: Concurrency**
- Explore Go's built-in support for concurrency with Goroutines and Channels.
- Understand how to create Goroutines and communicate between them using Channels.
- Write simple concurrent programs to grasp the concept.

**Day 7: Final Projects and Practice**
- Spend this day working on small projects and exercises to reinforce your knowledge.
- Explore online resources, Go documentation, and forums for additional learning and problem-solving.
- Review the concepts you've learned throughout the week.

Learning a new programming language is an ongoing process, and Go has a lot to offer. While this one-week plan will give you a good foundation, continue to build your skills and knowledge in Go by working on real-world projects and regularly practicing. Additionally, consider reading Go documentation and books, and participate in Go communities to accelerate your learning.

`I also asked chat GPT to help me with the best resources to learn and practice GO`

Certainly! Learning Go (Golang) can be an enjoyable experience with the right resources that include exercises and projects. Here are some of the best resources to learn Go, along with exercises and projects:

1. **The Go Programming Language (Book)**:
   - The official Go book written by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.
   - It covers the language in depth and includes practical exercises and examples.
   - Provides a comprehensive understanding of Go and how to use it effectively.
